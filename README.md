An investigation into microhole shape deformation using the node-mesh morphing technique and multi-regression analysis applied to an injection molded component.


Abstract: A unique method was used to assess the design configuration of a microhole component utilizing the coordinate geometry system. The microhole component was accurately defined with parameters and node-mesh techniques were used. Injection molding simulations were conducted computationally for all chosen parameter combinations. Regression models were developed for the microhole component coordinate system using specific statistical criteria. The performance parameters of the models were eventually analyzed. The deflection of the microhole component varied with melt temperatures, showing good agreement with the after-deformation effect of the coordinate system in predicting deflection changes. However, higher melting temperatures and a well-defined gate location significantly reduced deflection behavior.
